# Week five project
## Command line interface

I ported Elecia's code from Wokowi and made a few changes:

1. I wanted to use a circular buffer - taken from the book with a couple of extra functions.
2. I wanted to handle backspaces when typing so wrote a routing to handle that when a command is returned. 

The rest is much the same.
