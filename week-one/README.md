# The Garden Guardian 
![Alt text](https://github.com/graeme-gets/making-embedded-projects/blob/main/week-one/Guardian-Sketch.png)
## Overview
The Garden Guardian is an all in one , selective animal deterrent and weed killer. The idea behind this project is to deter animals that cause issues in a garden or veg patch, but only specific animals.  
For instance, you may wish to deter a squirrel or fox, but not a bird. Or at a bird bath, you want to deter cats but not birds.  Or… you want to deter birds from your fruit but not your carrots. 

This could be used as an human intruder deterrent as well.

The device will monitor a 360˚ area, detecting objects and deciding if they need to be deterred or not. If the object matches an animal that should be deterred, the unit will aim and fire/pulse a water jet at the animal. If the animal is not deterred, the laser can be used to further convince the animal. 
A loud speaker can also be used to create noises that might deter animals.

Snails and slugs would be killed using the laser. 

The user can control the device from a device or web browser to either manually fire the water jet/laser or to capture images of the animals detected. This data could be used for track and monitor the animal population in the garden. 

**The device consists of**
- Image/ object recognition 
-	Stereoscopic camera for object detection and distance calculations.
-	Articulated arm for maximum coverage and aim of deterrent
-	Water jet as a deterrent 
-	Laser for ‘sharper’ deterrent and weed killer
-	Wi-Fi for remote control, logging and image capture
-	Loud Speaker
